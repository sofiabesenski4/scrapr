# scrapr
web scraper by the Besenski duo

## Setup
We use direnv and pyenv to manage python versions, libraries, and setting the `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable.
The app is not constrained to this choice, though, since nothing is checked into the repo.

TODO

Capybara!! Feature testing!!
